How to help you to secure Internet of Things applications? <br/>

We propose the STAC application, a semantic-based application to suggest you the best security mechanism! <br/>
<a href="http://securitytoolbox.appspot.com/" >STAC (Security Toolbox: Attacks & Coutermeasures)</a>
</p>

<p>
  This project aims to help a non-security expert
software designers or developers to: (1) design secure software and, (2) to understand and be aware of main security
concepts and issues. 
<br/><br/>
We define the main security concepts such as attacks, countermeasures, security properties and their relationships. Countermeasures can be
cryptographic concepts (encryption algorithm, key management, digital signature, hash function), security tools or security protocols. 

<br/> <br/>We propose security mechanisms in numerous domains such as security of web applications, network management or communication networks (sensor, cellular and wireless).
