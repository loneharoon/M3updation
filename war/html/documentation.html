<h3>Developing semantic-based IoT applications with M3</h3> 	
   <a href="documentation/M3APIDocumentation.pdf">M3 API and user interface documentation</a> to query our web services or use our tools to develop domain-specific or cross-domain IoT applications to reason on sensor data.
   There is also a tutorial to develop semantic-based IoT applications with M3 and the Jena framework.

<h3>M3 Nomenclature</h3> 
<a href="documentation/NomenclatureSensorData.pdf">M3 Nomenclature</a> to describe sensor metadata in a unified/standardized way (sensor type, measurement type, unit and domains).
   By following this nomenclature to describe sensor metadata, it will  be easier to automate the reasoning.
   <br/> The M3 nomenclature has been implemented in our <a href="../?p=ontologies">M3 ontology</a>. 
   

<h3>M3 Developer Documentation to reuse the code</h3> 
   <a href="documentation/M3DeveloperDocumentation.pdf">Set up, run and understand M3 and its web services</a> to contribute
